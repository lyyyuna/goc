// A Context specifies the supporting context for a build.
type Context struct {
	GOARCH string // target architecture
	GOOS   string // target operating system
	GOROOT string // Go root
	GOPATH string // Go path

	// Dir is the caller's working directory, or the empty string to use
	// the current directory of the running process. In module mode, this is used
	// to locate the main module.
	//
	// If Dir is non-empty, directories passed to Import and ImportDir must
	// be absolute.
	Dir string

	CgoEnabled  bool   // whether cgo files are included
	UseAllFiles bool   // use files regardless of +build lines, file names
	Compiler    string // compiler to assume when computing target paths

	// The build and release tags specify build constraints
	// that should be considered satisfied when processing +build lines.
	// Clients creating a new context may customize BuildTags, which
	// defaults to empty, but it is usually an error to customize ReleaseTags,
	// which defaults to the list of Go releases the current release is compatible with.
	// BuildTags is not set for the Default build Context.
	// In addition to the BuildTags and ReleaseTags, build constraints
	// consider the values of GOARCH and GOOS as satisfied tags.
	// The last element in ReleaseTags is assumed to be the current release.
	BuildTags   []string
	ReleaseTags []string

	// The install suffix specifies a suffix to use in the name of the installation
	// directory. By default it is empty, but custom builds that need to keep
	// their outputs separate can set InstallSuffix to do so. For example, when
	// using the race detector, the go command uses InstallSuffix = "race", so
	// that on a Linux/386 system, packages are written to a directory named
	// "linux_386_race" instead of the usual "linux_386".
	InstallSuffix string

	// By default, Import uses the operating system's file system calls
	// to read directories and files. To read from other sources,
	// callers can set the following functions. They all have default
	// behaviors that use the local file system, so clients need only set
	// the functions whose behaviors they wish to change.

	// JoinPath joins the sequence of path fragments into a single path.
	// If JoinPath is nil, Import uses filepath.Join.
	JoinPath func(elem ...string) string

	// SplitPathList splits the path list into a slice of individual paths.
	// If SplitPathList is nil, Import uses filepath.SplitList.
	SplitPathList func(list string) []string

	// IsAbsPath reports whether path is an absolute path.
	// If IsAbsPath is nil, Import uses filepath.IsAbs.
	IsAbsPath func(path string) bool

	// IsDir reports whether the path names a directory.
	// If IsDir is nil, Import calls os.Stat and uses the result's IsDir method.
	IsDir func(path string) bool

	// HasSubdir reports whether dir is lexically a subdirectory of
	// root, perhaps multiple levels below. It does not try to check
	// whether dir exists.
	// If so, HasSubdir sets rel to a slash-separated path that
	// can be joined to root to produce a path equivalent to dir.
	// If HasSubdir is nil, Import uses an implementation built on
	// filepath.EvalSymlinks.
	HasSubdir func(root, dir string) (rel string, ok bool)

	// ReadDir returns a slice of os.FileInfo, sorted by Name,
	// describing the content of the named directory.
	// If ReadDir is nil, Import uses ioutil.ReadDir.
	ReadDir func(dir string) ([]os.FileInfo, error)

	// OpenFile opens a file (not a directory) for reading.
	// If OpenFile is nil, Import uses os.Open.
	OpenFile func(path string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
